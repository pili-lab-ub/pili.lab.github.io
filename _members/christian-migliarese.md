# Bio
Christian is a Ph.D. student in the Department of Pathology and Anatomical 
Sciences, where he began his doctoral studies in Summer 2024. He holds a 
bachelor’s degree in biotechnology from the University of Cagliari (2021) and a 
master’s degree in biotechnology and molecular biology from Vita-Salute San 
Raffaele University in Milan (2024).

Christian’s work focuses on elucidating epigenetic mechanisms underlying 
resistance to receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitors (RTKIs) in clear cell renal cell 
carcinoma (ccRCC). By identifying the epigenomic signatures linked to treatment 
resistance, he aims to develop therapeutic strategies that reprogram tumor cells 
to restore drug sensitivity. He is also involved in the development of 
small-molecule inhibitors targeting the dimerization interface of TFE3, a 
transcription factor and oncogenic driver in translocation renal cell carcinoma 
(tRCC).
